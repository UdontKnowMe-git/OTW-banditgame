# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Journey: The Quest for Knowledge
> "The more you know, the more you realize you don't know."

## About This Repo
This repository serves as my personal lab notebook and progress tracker as I transition into the world of **Ethical Hacking and Bug Bounty Hunting**. 

My goal is to move beyond "script kiddie" status by building a rock-solid foundation in Linux internals, networking, and web vulnerabilities. I am documenting my solutions, thought processes, and the hurdles I've overcome to sharpen my technical mindset.

## Current Focus: OverTheWire (Bandit)
I am currently working through the **Bandit** wargames. These challenges are designed to teach the fundamentals of the Linux command line and security concepts.

### Skills I'm Sharpening:
* **Linux Navigation:** Mastering the CLI and filesystem hierarchy.
* **Data Filtering:** Using `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, and `strings` to find needles in haystacks.
* **File Metadata:** Understanding permissions, file types, and hidden attributes.
* **SSH & Networking:** Securely connecting to remote servers and understanding port configurations.

## Learning Path
- [x] **Phase 1: Linux Foundations** (In Progress: OverTheWire Bandit)
- [ ] **Phase 2: Networking Basics** (Planned: TryHackMe Pre-Security)
- [ ] **Phase 3: Web Security** (Planned: PortSwigger Academy)
- [ ] **Phase 4: Active Bug Bounty Hunting** (Planned: Hacker101 / Bugcrowd)

## 🚩 Bandit Series: Graduation Summary
* **Linux Fundamentals:** Navigated complex file systems, hidden directories, and special filenames.
* **Permissions & Owners:** Exploited SetUID binaries and learned the nuances of `chmod`, `chown`, and `umask`.
* **Network Recon:** Used `nc`, `telnet`, `nmap`, and `openssl` to interact with remote services and encrypted ports.
* **Automation:** Analyzed `cron` jobs and wrote Bash scripts to intercept data and brute-force PINs.
* **Git Forensics:** Recovered "deleted" secrets from commit histories and tags.
* **Shell Escapes:** Broke out of restricted environments using pagers (`more`), editors (`vim`), and positional parameters (`$0`).
