# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Journey: The Quest for Knowledge
> "The more you know, the more you realize you don't know."

## About This Repo
This repository serves as my personal lab notebook and progress tracker as I transition into the world of **Ethical Hacking and Bug Bounty Hunting**. 

My goal is to move beyond "script kiddie" status by building a rock-solid foundation in Linux internals, networking, and web vulnerabilities. I am documenting my solutions, thought processes, and the hurdles I've overcome to sharpen my technical mindset.

## Current Focus: OverTheWire (Bandit)
I am currently working through the **Bandit** wargames. These challenges are designed to teach the fundamentals of the Linux command line and security concepts.

### Skills I'm Sharpening:
* **Linux Navigation:** Mastering the CLI and filesystem hierarchy.
* **Data Filtering:** Using `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, and `strings` to find needles in haystacks.
* **File Metadata:** Understanding permissions, file types, and hidden attributes.
* **SSH & Networking:** Securely connecting to remote servers and understanding port configurations.

## Learning Path
- [x] **Phase 1: Linux Foundations** (In Progress: OverTheWire Bandit)
- [ ] **Phase 2: Networking Basics** (Planned: TryHackMe Pre-Security)
- [ ] **Phase 3: Web Security** (Planned: PortSwigger Academy)
- [ ] **Phase 4: Active Bug Bounty Hunting** (Planned: Hacker101 / Bugcrowd)

## Latest Breakthroughs
* **Level 4 -> 5:** Learned how to use `file` and wildcards to distinguish human-readable text from binary data.
* **Level 5 -> 6:** Mastered the `find` command to search for specific file sizes and attributes across recursive directories.
