connect to bandit6 with given password


- Level 6

Had new concepts such as how a file can be owned by a user as well as a group. Had to find a file from a random
location on the server where the file was owned by group bandit6, owned by user bandit7, is exactly 33 bytes.
Used find with user and group flags, also "2>&1" to redirect the stderr stream into the stdout stream for proper
grep handling and giving me exactly which files to look for.

Output:

bandit6@bandit:~$ find / -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6 2>&1 | grep "Permission denied" -v
find: ‘/proc/99/task/99/fd/6’: No such file or directory
find: ‘/proc/99/task/99/fdinfo/6’: No such file or directory
find: ‘/proc/99/fd/5’: No such file or directory
find: ‘/proc/99/fdinfo/5’: No such file or directory
/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
bandit6@bandit:~$ cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
morbNTDkSW6jIlUc0ymOdMaLnOlFVAaj

Another way is to use the /dev/null "Linux void" to just filter out the stderr stream entirely

Output:

bandit6@bandit:~$ find / -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6 2>/dev/null
/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
bandit6@bandit:~$

connect to bandit7 with given password


- Level 7

Had to find the password, which was near the word "millionth" inside a very large text file.
Used grep to get the line out

Output:

bandit7@bandit:~$ grep "millionth" data.txt
millionth       dfwvzFQi4mU0wfNbFOe9RoWskMLg7eEc
____________

connect to bandit8 with given password


- Level 8

The password is the string occurring only once in the data.txt file
Used uniq and sort command, Had to sort first because uniq wont work unless
the duplicate lines are next to each other.

Output:

bandit8@bandit:~$ dir
data.txt
bandit8@bandit:~$ du data.txt
36      data.txt
bandit8@bandit:~$ sort data.txt | uniq -u
